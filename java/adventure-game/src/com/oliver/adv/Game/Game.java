/*** Assumptions ***/

// Available directions do not need to be printed, as that is depicted on the map

// No support for choosing player's name

// Room size is not depicted

// Missing blocks in example drawing are just red squares on map

// ~~A user will have their weapon in their hand, and it will still be in their inventory.~~ This is no longer a thing.

// An entity's damage is determined by:
//   * base damage
//   * every weapon in their intervory's damage increase

// Dragon is not printed :(

// Player can walk right through empty spaces. This is by design, but doesn't feel very intuitive.


/*** Improvements to be made ***/

// A RoomManager to declutter the game class? Most of the logic in Game would be moved. 7 jan 22:00 is too late :(

// Make the room map a kind of 2d linked list? Have each door point to a room?

// Allow player to exit =)


/*** Naming convention ***/

// Public fields and methods: PascalCase
// private fields, local variables, and get/setter methods: camelCase
